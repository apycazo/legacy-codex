# Codex

This repo is intended as a personal reference central point. The repo is currently a work in progress,
as I try to merge all the samples, snippets and ideas I have in here. Currently the most work is going towards 
the Java Spring Boot references.

The codex is splitted into three 'branches' so far:

* codex-spring: This contains a maven aggregator pom.xml file for the two main modules I currently have: 'base', containing some common spring boot functionalities, and 'rest' containing references useful for creating rest services.
* codex-nodejs: Pending refactoring, I have just included all my references and tests I have been able to find.
* codex-angularjs: Same thing, just with angular.
